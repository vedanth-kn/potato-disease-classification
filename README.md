### Potato Disease Classification

In the agricultural sector, potato cultivation is vital to the economy and food supply. However,
potato plants are susceptible to diseases that can significantly impact yield and quality. Among the
most common and devastating diseases are Early Blight and Late Blight, which can lead to substantial 
crop losses if not detected and managed promptly. Traditional methods of disease identification are
often manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error, making it challenging for farmers to diagnose
and address these issues effectively.
